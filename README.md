## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Munna Kumar, I have completed my graduation in Bachelor of Computer Application from Patliputra University and have recently completed my certification course in Data Science from TGC,Delhi. I developed a passion for data science during my graduation where I came to know about data analysis and machine learning and the power of data in driving decision-making. I am proficient in Python, and I have experience with data manipulation using Pandas and NumPy, as well as data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn. I believe that strong communication skills are essential in data science, as it allows me to convey complex insights to non-technical stakeholders. I am eager to learn and stay updated with the latest trends in data science, and I regularly participate in online courses and workshops. My goal is to contribute to impactful data-driven projects and eventually specialize in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am excited about the opportunity to apply my skills and contribute to innovative projects in the field of data science.
